* write functions for:
 - module/class fetch
 - class def (alloc, free, etc)
 - string to/from
 - number to/from
 - bool to/from
 - isTruthy/isFalsey (rtest)

* modify call/defs to take sum type of Block (nothing/val/fun)

* write a Proc creater, which will work by:
  - creating a new Object,
  - defining a call method on it,
  - perform Proc.new(&obj.method(:call))
* clean up initialization - create dedicated rupee_init HS/C

* export all rb_c* and rb_m* modules/classes, in Foreign.Rupee.Modules
* export rb_stdin, rb_stdout, rb_stderr; note that these are mutables, and set
    through $std{out,in,err}

* when initializing C lib, create proc constructor object, which,
  when passed a 
  

DONE
----
* make defMethod functions GCable
  - need to write some sort of Finalizer class on the c side
